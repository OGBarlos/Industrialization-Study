# Industrialization-Study
GitHub repo for my 2025 industrialization study, which acts as the culmination of everything I researched in my previous studies, tying it to a single variable (industrialization), and how industrialization effects nature.

Finally sharing my 4th and final installment of independent studies on climate change (the first 3 being my studies on hurricanes, global temperature, and sea level)

This study was the culmination of everything I researched in my previous studies, tying it to a single variable (industrialization), and how industrialization effects nature. All of the analysis was done in Python, using various libraries, while the document itself was created in Overleaf, a LaTeX editor. I wanted to use a variety of statistical analyses, as well as descriptive analyses to get a coherent view of the many branches of Earth's climate, and how various sectors of industry impact the climate in different ways.


Being conscious of our decisions helps us make better decisions and keeps the Earth healthy.
